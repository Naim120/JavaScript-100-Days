            The four seasons are spring, summer, fall (also known as autumn),
            and winter. They are characterized by distinct changes in
            temperature, weather patterns, and daylight hours. Spring is a time
            of renewal and growth, while summer brings warmth and long days.
            Fall is known for its colorful foliage and harvest, and winter is
            marked by colder temperatures and shorter days.

              Spring is the season of renewal and growth, marked by warmer
              temperatures, longer days, and budding trees and flowers. It's a
              time for new beginnings and fresh starts, as many animals emerge
              from hibernation and birds return from migration. Spring is also
              associated with Easter and other cultural and religious
              celebrations.

              Summer is the season of warmth and relaxation, marked by longer
              days, sunny weather, and outdoor activities. It's a time for beach
              trips, barbecues, and family vacations, as well as festivals and
              concerts. Many people associate summer with ice cream, swimming
              pools, and lazy days spent in the sun.

              Winter is the season of cold weather and snow, with shorter days
              and longer nights. It's a time for holiday celebrations, warm
              drinks, and cozy fireside gatherings. Outdoor activities include
              skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating. Winter also brings the
              magic of snow-covered landscapes and the excitement of the holiday
              season.

              Fall, or autumn, is a season of colorful foliage and cooler
              weather. It's a time of harvest festivals, pumpkin patches, and
              apple picking. The shorter days and longer nights provide a
              perfect atmosphere for cozy nights in. Outdoor activities include
              hiking and biking in the crisp air. Fall is a time of change and
              transition, as nature prepares for the coming winter.
