          Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of
          mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not
          merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the
          interests of others. Have this attitude in yourselves which was also
          in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not
          regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself,
          taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of
          men. Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by
          becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For
          this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name
          which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee
          will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
          and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
          glory of God the Father.
