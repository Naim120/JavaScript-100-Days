            A ballerina is a highly skilled dancer who specializes in the art of
            classical ballet. To become a ballerina, one must start training at
            a young age, usually around the age of six or seven. This early
            start is necessary to develop the flexibility, strength, and
            coordination required to execute the complex movements of ballet.
            Ballerinas possess a grace and poise that is unparalleled, and their
            movements are often described as fluid and effortless. Despite the
            demanding nature of the profession, ballerinas find great joy in
            their art, and their performances inspire and enchant audiences
            around the world.
